Stuff for kurt -- 8/8/2000

readme.txt - This file.

WikiWord.dot - Document template for making wiki documents.  Stick it
               in the same directory as your normal.dot file.  Include
               all the macros.  I need to write some documentation.

personal-log.el - I think this is all you need for my personal log
                  mode.  It is very simple minded, so don't hit me too
                  bad.  It is one of the very first real things I did
                  in emacs lisp.

wiki.doc - A wiki full of useless information.  Just to get an idea of
           how a wiki.doc looks after it has been created.
